    of charms, spells, and secrecy. Wizards are forbidden to reveal 
    anything about magic to Muggle society due to the International 
    Statute of Wizarding Secrecy. Each country has a form of 
    wizarding government to oversee magical affairs in their 
    territory, such as a Ministry of Magic or a Council of Magic. 
    The International Confederation of Wizards serves as a wizarding 
    intergovernmental organisation.`,

    To the east is a desert, the Aiel Waste, inhabited by the 
    Aiel warrior people, who live in small settlements and whose 
    society is organized into clans and warrior societies. 
    Further east is the large and predominantly insular nation 
    of Shara, separated from the Waste by large mountain ranges 
    and other impassable terrain. North of all three regions is 
    the Great Blight, a hostile wilderness inhabited by evil 
    beings. The Westlands are mostly temperate; it and the Aiel 
    Waste are located in the world's northern mid-latitudes. 
    Shara extends slightly south of the equator. Across an ocean 
    west of the Westlands is Seanchan, the name of a landmass 
    and the empire that spans it. Seanchan is narrower from 
    east to west than the other landmass, but extends most 
    of the way between the ice caps from south to north. A large 
    island in the northwest is separated from the Seanchan mainland 
    by a channel.`,
