    live and interact separate from the Muggle (non-wizarding) 
    society. The two communities are kept separate through the use 
    of charms, spells, and secrecy. Wizards are forbidden to reveal 
    anything about magic to Muggle society due to the International 
    Statute of Wizarding Secrecy. Each country has a form of 
    wizarding government to oversee magical affairs in their 
    territory, such as a Ministry of Magic or a Council of Magic. 
    The International Confederation of Wizards serves as a wizarding 
    intergovernmental organisation.`,

    much in common with the things we find familiar. But there are 
    still wonders to behold hidden just out of sight. A magical
